# ASAP physical operators

An independent Rust physical operator DAG runtime shared by ingestion time and
query time execution. The library requires neither backend engine, a server,
a storage implementation, Arrow nor DataFusion. DataFusion informed the design;
it is not the execution framework.

`dag::PhysicalDag` binds typed operator inputs to node IDs. Each execution starts
one producer per reachable node, shares output batches among its consumers, and
bounds buffering. Dropping one consumer does not cancel other consumers. A
`RunContext` carries query or ingestion scope, cancellation and byte accounting.
Executions use the caller's worker and worker-local streams, with no internal
thread pool. Poll multiple root streams concurrently when they share inputs.

`dag::operators::Operator` implements native batch sources, scalar values,
projection, filtering, grouped exact aggregation, semi-join, grouped Sort and
Limit, vector-to-scalar conversion, Union, and summary construction/merge/readout.
Sort followed by Limit implements grouped ranking; no dedicated TopK physical
operator is needed. Summary construction updates state batch by batch. End of
input means the supplied query range or ingestion window is complete.

```rust
use asap_physical_operators::dag::{
    operators::{Expression, Operator},
    values::Value,
    Limits, PhysicalDag, RunContext, Scope,
};
use asap_physical_operators::planner::pre_asap::DataType;
use futures::{executor::block_on, StreamExt};

let source = Operator::scalar(Value::Int64(7), DataType::Int64)?;
let negate = Operator::project(source.schema(), vec![
    ("value".into(), Expression::Negate(Box::new(Expression::Column(0)))),
])?;
let mut plan = PhysicalDag::default();
plan.add(0, vec![], source)?;
plan.add(1, vec![0], negate)?;
let run = RunContext::new(
    Scope::Query { evaluation_time_ms: 1000, revision: 1 },
    Limits::default(),
)?;
let mut output = plan.execute(&[1], run)?.remove(0);
let batch = block_on(output.next()).unwrap()?;
assert!(matches!(batch.rows()[0][0], Value::Int64(-7)));
# Ok::<(), asap_physical_operators::dag::Error>(())
```

`dag::planner::bind` accepts a post-ASAP DAG and explicit source bindings for
installed ingestion/storage frontiers. It rejects unsupported operations and
schema mismatches before starting a source. Implement `PhysicalOperator` for a
deployment source, including asynchronous I/O; computation operators remain in
the library. The public `planner` export identifies the exact Planner types used
by the crate. The native binder currently supports a subset of those types and
operations; it does not interpret an unknown node as external fallback.

Plain values preserve Planner scalar/collection types and nullability. Numeric
arithmetic uses matching Int64 or Float64 inputs; integer overflow is an error.
Boolean predicates use three-valued logic. Native summary states currently cover
exact Sum/Count/Min/Max/Rate/Increase, KLL, DDSketch and HLL. Binding checks family,
parameters and readout compatibility; source batches also validate state payloads.
Existing accumulator algorithms are reused as kernels behind these operators.

Backend ingestion integration is delivered in #763 and query integration in
#765, after this foundation. Installed value/storage adapters provide deployment-specific
computation; they have not all been replaced by native batch bindings. Local raw
Scan remains deferred. See the [shared operator design](../../docs/design_docs/physical-operators.md).
The dependent #765 query DAG design tracks installed engine coverage separately.

The default limits are eight buffered batches per producer and 64 MiB of estimated
retained execution data. Callers can set both through `Limits`. Accounting includes
consumer-held outputs and reserved operator state, but is not a hard RSS cap or an
allocator hook. Source-owned data and temporary allocation peaks are excluded.
Blocking operators have no spill support. Plan depth is limited to 128. No execution
state is shared between runs, and no implicit fallback or legacy traversal API is
provided.

Run `cargo test -p asap-physical-operators --locked` for the independent library
acceptance tests, including shared producers, backpressure, cancellation, grouping,
state restoration and raw/partial/fully precomputed DAG examples. These examples
supply in-memory batches; they do not establish backend local raw-Scan support.
