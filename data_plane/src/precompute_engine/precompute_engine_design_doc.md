# Precompute Engine Design Document

## 1. Overview

The Precompute Engine is a real-time streaming aggregation system that sits between
metric producers and ASAP storage and query engine. It accepts raw
time-series samples via multiple ingestion connectors (Prometheus remote write
and VictoriaMetrics remote write), buffers them, computes windowed aggregations
(sketches), and writes the results to a store for fast query-time retrieval.

**Key properties:**
- Single-machine, multi-threaded architecture (all workers run as async tasks within one process)
- Watermark-based windowed aggregation (tumbling and sliding windows)
- Shared-nothing worker design: series are hash-partitioned across threads with no cross-worker coordination
- Pluggable accumulator types (Sum, Min/Max, Increase, KLL, CMS, HydraKLL)
- Configurable late-data handling (Drop or ForwardToStore)
- Optional raw passthrough mode for bypassing aggregation

                          (PromQL / SQL / etc.)
```

A periodic **flush timer** broadcasts `Flush` messages to all workers so that
windows that would otherwise remain open (no new samples arriving) are closed
and emitted.

## 2.1 Watermark Propagation

### How watermarks work

A watermark is a monotonically increasing timestamp assertion: **"no more events
with timestamp <= W will arrive."** It tells the system when a time window can
be safely closed and its results emitted.

```
Time ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────►

Event Stream (arriving out of order):
  t=3  t=1  t=5  t=2  t=7  t=4  t=9  t=6  t=11  t=8  t=13
   ●    ●    ●    ●    ●    ●    ●    ●    ●     ●     ●

Watermark (max_ts - allowed_lateness, where lateness=2):
  W=1  W=1  W=3  W=3  W=5  W=5  W=7  W=7  W=9   W=9  W=11
   ─────┘    ─────┘    ─────┘    ─────┘    ─────┘      │
   (no advance,       (advances)                        │
    older event)                                        │

Window Lifecycle (window_size=5, slide=5):
                                                        │
  ┌─────────────────────┐                               │
  │  Window [0, 5)      │                               │
  │  collects: t=3,1,2,4│                               │
  │                     │── W=5 crosses end ──► EMIT    │
  └─────────────────────┘                               │
                                                        │
        ┌─────────────────────┐                         │
        │  Window [5, 10)     │                         │
        │  collects: t=5,7,9,6│                         │
        │                     │── W=11 crosses end      │
        └─────────────────────┘           ──► EMIT      │
                                                        │
              ┌─────────────────────┐                   │
              │  Window [10, 15)    │                    │
              │  collects: t=11,13  │  (still open,     │
              │  ...waiting...      │   W=11 < 15)      │
              └─────────────────────┘                   │


Late data handling:

  Timeline:    ... t=6  t=10  t=3 ...
                    ●     ●    ●
                              │
               Watermark W=8 ─┘
               t=3 < W - allowed_lateness(2) = 6?
               3 < 6 → YES, late → DROP (or ForwardToStore)
```

### Cross-group watermark propagation

Without cross-group propagation, each group tracks its own watermark
independently. If a group stops receiving data, its watermark freezes and its
windows never close. Cross-group propagation solves this with two layers:

**Layer 1 — Intra-worker (max):** Each worker computes its worker watermark as
`max(all group watermarks)`. This represents "time has progressed to at least
here on this worker." During each flush, idle groups are advanced to the worker
watermark.

**Layer 2 — Cross-worker (min):** Each worker publishes its worker watermark to
a shared `Arc<AtomicI64>`. The global watermark is `min(all worker watermarks)`,
ignoring workers that have not yet started. This becomes the floor for all group
watermarks across all workers.

```

              global_wm = min(100s, 80s, 90s) = 80s

              On flush, each group's effective watermark becomes:
                max(group_wm, global_wm) + 1ms

              Worker 0: Group B (50s) → advanced to 80s → closes [50s, 80s] windows
              Worker 2: Group F (30s) → advanced to 80s → closes [30s, 80s] windows
```

**Why max within a worker?** We want to propagate forward progress from active
groups to idle groups on the same worker.

**Why min across workers?** Conservative: only advance as far as ALL workers
agree time has progressed. If worker 1 is behind at 80s, we should not close
windows at 90s on worker 2 because worker 1 might still send data for those
windows.

**Staleness:** Because workers read each other's atomics during flush, the
global watermark may be up to one `flush_interval_ms` (default 1s) stale.
This is acceptable — it only means idle groups close windows one flush cycle
later than they theoretically could.

**Unstarted workers:** Workers that have not yet received any data remain at
`i64::MIN` and are excluded from the global watermark min calculation. This
prevents a cold worker from blocking the entire system.

## 3. Components

### 3.1 PrecomputeEngine (`mod.rs`)

Top-level orchestrator. On `run()`:

1. Creates one `mpsc::channel<WorkerMessage>` per worker.
2. Constructs a `SeriesRouter` with the sender halves.
3. Spawns `Worker` tasks, each owning its receiver.
4. Spawns a flush timer that calls `router.broadcast_flush()` every
   `flush_interval_ms`.
5. Starts the Axum HTTP server with routes for each ingest connector and blocks until shutdown.

```rust
pub struct PrecomputeEngine {
    config: PrecomputeEngineConfig,
    streaming_config: Arc<StreamingConfig>,
    output_sink: Arc<dyn OutputSink>,
}
```

### 3.2 Configuration (`config.rs`)

```rust
pub struct PrecomputeEngineConfig {
    pub num_workers: usize,              // default: 4
    pub allowed_lateness_ms: i64,        // default: 5,000
    pub max_buffer_per_series: usize,    // default: 10,000
    pub flush_interval_ms: u64,          // default: 1,000
    pub channel_buffer_size: usize,      // default: 10,000
    pub pass_raw_samples: bool,          // default: false
    pub raw_mode_aggregation_id: u64,    // default: 0
    pub late_data_policy: LateDataPolicy, // default: Drop
}

pub enum LateDataPolicy {
    Drop,            // Silently discard late samples for closed windows
    ForwardToStore,  // Emit a mini-accumulator for query-time merge
}
```

### 3.3 SeriesRouter (`series_router.rs`)

Deterministic hash-based routing using XXHash64:

```
worker_idx = xxhash64(series_key) % num_workers
```

All samples for a given series always land on the same worker, so per-series
state (buffer, watermark, active windows) needs no synchronization.

**Message types:**
```rust
enum WorkerMessage {
    Samples { series_key: String, samples: Vec<(i64, f64)>, ingest_received_at: Instant },
    Flush,
    Shutdown,
}
```

`route_batch()` groups messages by target worker and sends them in parallel for
throughput while preserving per-worker ordering.

#### Load balancing trade-offs and alternatives

The current hash-mod scheme is correct and low-overhead but has four distinct failure modes. Each has a corresponding mitigation strategy.

**Problem 1: hash skew — uneven series count per worker**

With a good hash and N workers the variance in series count is O(√(S/N)), which is negligible at large S. Virtual nodes (each physical worker owns K hash ring slots) reduce variance further at zero runtime cost but are rarely necessary with xxhash64 in practice.

**Problem 2: hot series — a few series dominate sample volume**

The hash does not know about per-series sample rates. If one metric is scraped at 1 s while others are at 60 s, the owning worker handles 60× more samples.

*Mitigation — weight-aware initial placement:* on first sight of a series, assign it to the least-loaded worker (by current sample rate) and record the assignment in a small routing table that replaces the hash lookup. The assignment remains stable (one series = one worker always), so no cross-worker state is needed. The routing table fits in memory for millions of series. Works well when series rates are observable at assignment time (e.g. from Prometheus service discovery).

**Problem 3: GROUP BY fan-in — cross-worker store entries require query-time merge**

Because routing is by full series key, two series that share a `grouping_labels` value but differ in rolled-up labels land on different workers and emit independent accumulators for the same `(agg_id, key, window)` tuple (see §4). The store must append multiple entries and the query engine merges them.

*Mitigation A — route by grouping key:* use `xxhash64(grouping_key)` instead of the full series key. All series rolling up into the same GROUP BY bucket land on one worker, which merges them before emitting. The store gets exactly one entry per `(agg_id, key, window)` and no query-time fan-in is needed. Trade-offs: routing requires knowing the config's `grouping_labels` at ingest time; creates a new hot-key risk when one grouping value covers far more series than others; a series matched by multiple configs with different grouping keys would need to be sent to multiple workers.

*Mitigation B — two-phase aggregation:* keep routing by series key (local aggregation as now) but emit partial accumulators to a second tier of reduce-workers routed by grouping key. Reduce-workers merge partials and write a single entry to the store. Eliminates query-time fan-in without the hot-key risk. Adds one extra hop of latency and requires coordinating two flush cycles.

**Problem 4: static assignment — series stuck on overloaded workers**

Hash-based assignment is fixed for the lifetime of the process. A series that begins emitting at 100× its original rate stays on the same worker forever.

*Mitigation — state migration at window boundaries:* when a series has no open panes (i.e. `active_panes` is empty after a window close), its state can be serialized, sent to a new worker, and the routing table updated atomically. The empty-panes condition occurs naturally at every tumbling window boundary, or periodically for sliding windows after all panes are evicted. Operationally complex but sound — no split-window state is possible if migration is gated on the empty-panes condition.

**Practical signal: channel backpressure**

Before investing in any of the above, add observability to the bounded MPSC channels — if a worker's channel is frequently near capacity, that is the primary signal that routing is imbalanced. Exposing `channel.capacity()` (remaining slots) per worker as a metric is cheap and pinpoints which worker is the bottleneck, providing the data needed to choose between the mitigations above.


### 3.4 Worker (`worker.rs`)

Each worker owns an isolated shard of the series space.

```rust
struct Worker {
    id: usize,
    receiver: mpsc::Receiver<WorkerMessage>,
    output_sink: Arc<dyn OutputSink>,
    series_map: HashMap<String, SeriesState>,
    agg_configs: HashMap<u64, AggregationConfig>,
    max_buffer_per_series: usize,
    allowed_lateness_ms: i64,
    pass_raw_samples: bool,
    raw_mode_aggregation_id: u64,
    late_data_policy: LateDataPolicy,
}
```

**Per-series state:**
```rust
struct SeriesState {
    buffer: SeriesBuffer,                      // sorted sample buffer
    previous_watermark_ms: i64,                // last-seen watermark
    aggregations: Vec<AggregationState>,       // one per matching config
}

struct AggregationState {
    config: AggregationConfig,
    window_manager: WindowManager,
    active_panes: BTreeMap<i64, Box<dyn AccumulatorUpdater>>,
}
```

#### Accumulator lifecycle and ownership

Accumulators are not pre-assigned — they are created **lazily** at three nested levels:

**1. At engine startup** (`engine.rs`): every worker receives a full copy of all `AggregationConfig`s. All workers are symmetric; none is pre-assigned to any series or config.

```rust
let agg_configs = streaming_config.get_all_aggregation_configs().clone();
for (id, rx) in receivers {
    Worker::new(id, rx, sink.clone(), agg_configs.clone(), ...)
}
```

**2. On first sample for a series** (`get_or_create_series_state`): the worker calls `matching_agg_configs(series_key)` to filter the config map by metric name, then creates one `AggregationState` per match (a `WindowManager` + empty pane map). No accumulators exist yet.

```rust
let aggregations = matching_agg_configs(series_key).map(|(_, config)| AggregationState {
    window_manager: WindowManager::new(config.window_size, config.slide_interval),
    config: config.clone(),
    active_panes: BTreeMap::new(),   // ← empty; no memory allocated for sketches yet
}).collect();
```

**3. On first sample in a pane** (`process_samples`): the accumulator is created the moment a sample falls into a pane that does not yet exist in `active_panes`.

```rust
let updater = agg_state.active_panes
    .entry(pane_start)
    .or_insert_with(|| create_accumulator_updater(&agg_state.config));
```

**Ownership hierarchy:**

```
Worker
└── series_map[series_key]           one entry per series this worker owns
    └── aggregations[i]              one AggregationState per matching config
        └── active_panes[pane_start] one AccumulatorUpdater per open pane
            └── Box<dyn AggregateCore>   the actual sketch / sum / minmax / etc.
```

Because `xxhash64(series_key) % N` is deterministic, a series always lands on the same worker. Its accumulators live in exactly one worker with no sharing and no locking. Workers that never receive a series never allocate any state for it.

#### Pane-Based Sliding Window Optimization

The worker uses **pane-based incremental computation** to reduce per-sample
work for sliding windows. The timeline is divided into non-overlapping **panes**
of size `slide_interval`. Each window is composed of `W = window_size /
slide_interval` consecutive panes. Consecutive windows share W-1 panes.

```
Panes:     [0,10)  [10,20)  [20,30)  [30,40)  [40,50)
Window A:  [───────── 0,30 ─────────)
Window B:          [───────── 10,40 ─────────)
Window C:                  [───────── 20,50 ─────────)
```

**Why panes instead of subtraction?** Only Sum is invertible. MinMax, Increase,
KLL, CMS, HydraKLL are all non-invertible. Pane+merge works universally because
all accumulator types implement `AggregateCore::merge_with()`.

**Performance comparison** (N samples per window, W = window_size / slide_interval):

| | Per-window approach | Pane-based |
|--|---------|------------|
| Per-sample accumulator updates | N × W | N × 1 |
| Per-window-close merges | 0 | W - 1 |
| Per-window-close clones | 0 | W - 2 (shared panes) |

Net win when N >> W (typical: thousands of samples per window, W = 3-5).
For tumbling windows (W=1), panes degenerate to 1 pane = 1 window with
zero merges — identical behavior to the non-pane approach.

**Key methods:**

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pane_start_for(ts)` | Align timestamp to slide grid (same as `window_start_for`) |
| `panes_for_window(ws)` | All pane starts composing window `[ws, ws+size)` |
| `snapshot_accumulator()` | Non-destructive read of a pane's accumulator (for shared panes) |

**Pane eviction:** When window `[S, S+W)` closes, pane `[S, S+slide)` is the
oldest pane and is not needed by any later window (next window starts at
`S+slide`). It is destructively consumed via `take_accumulator()` and removed
from `active_panes`. Remaining panes are read non-destructively via
`snapshot_accumulator()`.

#### Processing pipeline (`process_samples`)

```
1. Match series to AggregationConfigs (by metric name / spatial_filter)
2. Insert samples into SeriesBuffer, update watermark
3. Drop samples beyond allowed_lateness_ms behind watermark
4. For each sample × each aggregation:
   a. Compute pane_start = pane_start_for(ts)
   b. If pane was evicted (late data for closed window):
      → late_data_policy == Drop:           skip
      → late_data_policy == ForwardToStore:  create mini-accumulator, emit
   c. Else: get-or-create pane in active_panes, feed value (1 update per sample)
5. Detect newly closed windows via closed_windows(prev_wm, current_wm)
6. For each closed window:
   a. Get pane starts via panes_for_window(window_start)
   b. Oldest pane: take_accumulator() + remove from active_panes (destructive)
   c. Remaining panes: snapshot_accumulator() (non-destructive, shared)
   d. Merge all pane accumulators via AggregateCore::merge_with()
   e. Emit merged result as PrecomputedOutput + AggregateCore
7. Emit batch to OutputSink
8. Update previous_watermark_ms
```

#### Raw mode

When `pass_raw_samples = true`, the entire aggregation pipeline is bypassed.
Each sample is emitted as a `SumAccumulator::with_sum(value)` with point-window
bounds `[ts, ts]` and the configured `raw_mode_aggregation_id`.
### 3.5 SeriesBuffer (`series_buffer.rs`)

Per-series in-memory buffer backed by `BTreeMap<i64, f64>`.

```rust
struct SeriesBuffer {
    samples: BTreeMap<i64, f64>,   // timestamp_ms → value
    watermark_ms: i64,              // max timestamp ever seen (monotonic)
    max_buffer_size: usize,
}
```

- Samples are automatically sorted by timestamp.
- Watermark only advances forward (monotonic).
- When the buffer exceeds `max_buffer_size`, the oldest samples are evicted.
- Supports range reads (`read_range`) and destructive drains (`drain_up_to`).

### 3.6 WindowManager (`window_manager.rs`)

Handles both tumbling and sliding window semantics.

```rust
struct WindowManager {
    window_size_ms: i64,       // e.g. 60_000
    slide_interval_ms: i64,    // == window_size for tumbling; < window_size for sliding
}
```

**Key methods:**

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `window_start_for(ts)` | Align timestamp down to nearest slide boundary |
| `window_starts_containing(ts)` | All windows whose `[start, start+size)` includes `ts`. Tumbling → 1 window; sliding → `ceil(size/slide)` windows |
| `closed_windows(prev_wm, curr_wm)` | Windows that transitioned open→closed as the watermark advanced |
| `window_bounds(start)` | Returns `(start, start + window_size_ms)` |
| `pane_start_for(ts)` | Pane start for a timestamp (same slide-aligned grid as `window_start_for`) |
| `panes_for_window(ws)` | All pane starts composing window `[ws, ws+size)`, in ascending order |
| `slide_interval_ms()` | Slide interval accessor |

**Window closure rule:** a window `[S, S + size)` closes when `watermark >= S + size`.
Once closed, a window never reopens.

#### Sliding window mechanics

Tumbling windows are a special case of sliding windows where
`slide_interval == window_size`. The same code handles both — no separate paths.

**`window_start_for(ts)`** aligns a timestamp to the slide grid:
```rust
let n = timestamp_ms.div_euclid(slide_interval_ms);
n * slide_interval_ms
```

**`window_starts_containing(ts)`** returns all windows whose `[start, start+size)`
contains the timestamp, by walking backwards from the aligned start:
```rust
let mut start = window_start_for(timestamp_ms);
while start + window_size_ms > timestamp_ms {
    starts.push(start);
    start -= slide_interval_ms;
}
```

For tumbling windows this always yields exactly 1 result. For sliding windows,
each sample belongs to `ceil(window_size / slide_interval)` overlapping windows.

**Example** (30s window, 10s slide):
```
t=15s → belongs to windows [0, 30s), [10s, 40s), [-10s, 20s)   (3 windows)
t=35s → belongs to windows [30s, 60s), [20s, 50s), [10s, 40s)  (3 windows)
```

**`closed_windows(prev_wm, curr_wm)`** finds windows that transitioned open→closed
as the watermark advanced. It scans forward from the earliest possibly-open window
start, collecting those where `start + size <= curr_wm` (now closed) AND
`start + size > prev_wm` (was still open before).

The worker calls `window_starts_containing(ts)` for each incoming sample and feeds
the value into the accumulator for every matching window. When
`closed_windows()` fires, each closed window's accumulator is extracted and
emitted independently.
### 3.7 AccumulatorUpdater (`accumulator_factory.rs`)

Trait-based interface for feeding samples into sketch accumulators:

```rust
trait AccumulatorUpdater: Send {
    fn update_single(&mut self, value: f64, timestamp_ms: i64);
    fn update_keyed(&mut self, key: &KeyByLabelValues, value: f64, timestamp_ms: i64);
    fn take_accumulator(&mut self) -> Box<dyn AggregateCore>;
    fn snapshot_accumulator(&self) -> Box<dyn AggregateCore>;  // non-destructive clone
    fn reset(&mut self);
    fn is_keyed(&self) -> bool;
    fn memory_usage_bytes(&self) -> usize;
}
```

`snapshot_accumulator()` returns a clone of the current state without resetting.
Used by pane-based sliding windows to read shared panes that are still needed
by future windows.

The factory function `create_accumulator_updater(config)` dispatches on
`(aggregation_type, aggregation_sub_type)`:

| Type | Sub-type | Updater |
|------|----------|---------|
| SingleSubpopulation | Sum | SumAccumulatorUpdater |
| SingleSubpopulation | Min/Max | MinMaxAccumulatorUpdater |
| SingleSubpopulation | Increase | IncreaseAccumulatorUpdater |
| SingleSubpopulation | KLL | KllAccumulatorUpdater |
| MultipleSubpopulation | Sum | MultipleSumUpdater |
| MultipleSubpopulation | Min/Max | MultipleMinMaxUpdater |
| MultipleSubpopulation | Increase | MultipleIncreaseUpdater |
| MultipleSubpopulation | CMS | CmsAccumulatorUpdater |
| MultipleSubpopulation | HydraKLL | HydraKllAccumulatorUpdater |

### 3.8 OutputSink (`output_sink.rs`)

```rust
trait OutputSink: Send + Sync {
    fn emit_batch(
        &self,
        outputs: Vec<(PrecomputedOutput, Box<dyn AggregateCore>)>,
    ) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>>;
}
```

**Implementations:**
- `StoreOutputSink` — calls `store.insert_precomputed_output_batch()`
- `RawPassthroughSink` — same interface, used for raw mode
- `NoopOutputSink` — testing helper that counts emitted items via `AtomicU64`
- `CapturingOutputSink` — testing helper that stores all emitted `(PrecomputedOutput, Box<dyn AggregateCore>)` pairs in a `Mutex<Vec<...>>`, with `drain()` and `len()` for assertions

## 4. Cross-Series (GROUP BY) Aggregation

### Label dimension roles

`AggregationConfig` has three label dimension fields that control the spatial aggregation shape:

| Field | Role |
|---|---|
| `grouping_labels` | Labels preserved in `PrecomputedOutput.key`; form the GROUP BY key visible at query time |
| `aggregated_labels` | Internal sub-keys for MultipleSubpopulation sketches (e.g. CMS, HydraKLL) |
| `rollup_labels` | Dropped entirely at ingest; not recoverable at query time |

A config with `grouping_labels: [job]` and `rollup_labels: [instance]` means: "aggregate across all instances, keep one output series per job value." Multiple input series (`metric{job=j1,instance=h1}`, `metric{job=j1,instance=h2}`, ...) all contribute to the same logical output key `(job=j1)`.

### Cross-worker fan-in

Because routing is by full series key (`xxhash64(series_key) % N`), two series that share a `grouping_labels` value but differ in rolled-up labels typically land on different workers:

```
metric{job=j1, instance=h1} → Worker 0 → pane accumulator with key (job=j1)
metric{job=j1, instance=h2} → Worker 3 → pane accumulator with key (job=j1)
```

Each worker independently closes its window and emits a separate `PrecomputedOutput` with key `(job=j1)` for the same window `[0, 60s)`. The store **appends** rather than overwrites on the same `(aggregation_id, key, window)` tuple:

```
store[(agg_id, key=(j1), [0,60s))] → [acc_worker0, acc_worker3]
```

Query-time `SummaryMergeMultipleExec` merges all entries for the same key and window via `AggregateCore::merge_with()`. No ingest-time cross-worker coordination is needed.

### Eventual consistency

Workers have independent watermarks. For a standard Prometheus scrape (all instances delivered in one HTTP batch via `route_batch()`), all workers receive their samples in the same round-trip and close the window on the same flush cycle. The incompleteness window — time between the first and last worker emitting for the same cross-series window — is typically milliseconds (bounded by Tokio task scheduling jitter).

For staggered multi-source producers arriving at different times, the incompleteness window is bounded by the spread of producer arrival times. In both cases the result is **eventually consistent**: once all contributing workers have emitted, the store holds a complete set of accumulators and queries return the correct merged value.

This deferred-merge design is intentional — it preserves the shared-nothing worker architecture with zero ingest-time cross-worker coordination. The store's append-multiple-per-window design and the query-time merge handle the fan-in correctly for both cross-series aggregation and `ForwardToStore` late data.

### Sliding windows with cross-worker GROUP BY

The pane-sharing optimization is an **intra-worker** implementation detail. From the store and query engine's perspective, each worker always emits a complete, self-consistent accumulator for each closed window — tumbling or sliding makes no difference to the cross-worker fan-in.

**Within a single worker** (e.g. Worker 0, series `{job=j1, instance=h1}`, 30s/10s sliding):

```
Window [0, 30s)  — panes [0, 10s, 20s]
  pane 0:   take (evict — no future window needs it)
  pane 10s: snapshot (shared with [10s, 40s))
  pane 20s: snapshot (shared with [10s, 40s) and [20s, 50s))
  → emit: acc_w0, key=(j1), window=[0,30s), sum = v_0 + v_10 + v_20

Window [10s, 40s)  — panes [10s, 20s, 30s]
  pane 10s: take (evict — snapshot for [0,30s) already completed)
  pane 20s: snapshot
  pane 30s: snapshot (or take, depending on future windows)
  → emit: acc_w0, key=(j1), window=[10s,40s), sum = v_10 + v_20 + v_30
```

Worker 3 (series `{job=j1, instance=h2}`) performs the same steps independently — its own pane `BTreeMap`, its own snapshots, its own emits.

**What the store sees:**

```
store[(agg_id, key=(j1), [0,  30s))] → [acc_w0, acc_w3]
store[(agg_id, key=(j1), [10s,40s))] → [acc_w0, acc_w3]
store[(agg_id, key=(j1), [20s,50s))] → [acc_w0, acc_w3]
```

Each entry is a complete accumulator from one worker for one window. Query-time merge combines them identically to the tumbling case.

The pane snapshot/take logic reduces memory and CPU inside each worker (avoiding re-accumulation of shared panes), but what exits the worker is always one standalone `Box<dyn AggregateCore>` per window. Consecutive sliding windows `[0,30s)` and `[10s,40s)` share panes *inside* the worker but have independent store entries — their cross-worker merges at query time are completely unrelated.

### Optional second-tier merge workers for cross-worker accumulator reduction

The current design relies on **query-time merge** for cross-worker fan-in. That
is sufficient for eventual consistency, but it leaves two important gaps:

1. **Query latency / repeated work** — queries must repeatedly merge
   per-worker fragments for the same `(aggregation_id, key, window)` tuple.
2. **No canonical reduced output** — the store holds worker-local fragments
   rather than a single merged accumulator for each logical output window.

This affects **all mergeable accumulators**, not just sliding-window sketches:

- tumbling-window group-by aggregates spread across workers
- sliding-window exact outputs
- keyed sketches such as CMS / HydraKLL
- late-data mini-accumulators emitted via `ForwardToStore`

Sliding windows are the strongest motivation because exact reads benefit most
from canonical pre-merged output, but the same second-tier reduction design can
be used for any accumulator type that implements `AggregateCore::merge_with()`.

To close those gaps without giving up shared-nothing ingest, add an optional
**second tier of merge workers** between the first-tier workers and the final
store.

#### Goal

Produce **one canonical accumulator per logical output window**:

```
(aggregation_id, grouping_key, window_start, window_end) -> merged accumulator
```

so that:

- the store can hold one merged output per `(aggregation_id, key, window)`
- query-time merge is reduced or eliminated for merge-tier-enabled aggregations
- distributed output matches the semantics of a single logical aggregation over
  the full input stream

For sliding windows, this gives semantic equivalence to a single logical
`HOP(slide, size)` aggregation over the distributed input stream. For tumbling
windows and other mergeable accumulators, it gives the same result the query
engine would otherwise have to reconstruct on read.

#### High-level architecture

```
Remote write
  -> SeriesRouter
  -> First-tier workers (per-series pane accumulation)
  -> MergeRouter
  -> Merge workers (per-window fan-in, all keys co-located)
  -> FinalOutputSink
  -> Store
```

The first tier is unchanged: it still owns all per-series pane state and emits
one standalone accumulator per closed window. The new part is that these emits
go to the `MergeRouter` instead of directly to the final store.

#### Routing key for the merge tier

All messages — both `PartialWindowAggregate` and `WindowCompletion` — are
routed by the **window identity alone**, without the grouping key:

```
merge_key = hash(aggregation_id, window_start_ms, window_end_ms)
```

This ensures that:

1. All partials for any key within the same window land on the same merge
   worker, so the merge worker can finalize all keys for a window in one pass.
2. `WindowCompletion` messages (which carry no key) route to exactly the same
   merge worker as the partials they complete, through the same MPSC channel.
   This preserves FIFO ordering: all `PartialWindowAggregate` messages from a
   first-tier worker for a given window are enqueued before its
   `WindowCompletion` for that window.

Routing by `(agg_id, key, window)` is explicitly avoided. It would put partials
for different keys on different merge workers, requiring `WindowCompletion` to be
broadcast to every merge worker — an O(M) fanout for M merge workers per
completion. Window-level routing eliminates that broadcast entirely.

#### Messages emitted by first-tier workers

Each first-tier worker emits two message types per closed window per
aggregation, always in this order within the same MPSC channel to the merge
worker:

1. Zero or more `PartialWindowAggregate` (one per series that had data in this
   window), followed immediately by:
2. Exactly one `WindowCompletion`

```rust
/// Partial result from one first-tier worker for one closed window.
/// Zero or more of these arrive before the WindowCompletion for the same
/// (aggregation_id, window_start_ms, window_end_ms, source_worker_id).
struct PartialWindowAggregate {
    aggregation_id: u64,
    key: Option<KeyByLabelValues>,   // grouping key extracted from the series
    window_start_ms: u64,
    window_end_ms: u64,
    source_worker_id: usize,
    accumulator: Box<dyn AggregateCore>,
}

/// Signals that source_worker_id will send no more on-time PartialWindowAggregates
/// for (aggregation_id, window_start_ms, window_end_ms).
/// One per (aggregation_id, window, source_worker_id) — no key field.
struct WindowCompletion {
    aggregation_id: u64,
    window_start_ms: u64,
    window_end_ms: u64,
    source_worker_id: usize,
    worker_watermark_ms: i64,   // the worker's watermark at the time of completion
}
```

`WindowCompletion` carries no `key` field. It is a window-level signal, not a
key-level signal. The merge worker infers which keys exist from the partials it
has received; it finalizes all observed keys once all sources have completed the
window.

Because both message types are enqueued into the **same MPSC channel** from a
given first-tier worker to its target merge worker, the merge worker always
observes partials before the completion for the same
`(aggregation_id, window, source)` triple. No additional ordering guarantee is
needed.

#### First-tier worker watermark for WindowCompletion

`WindowCompletion` must be emitted by **every** first-tier worker for every
window of every aggregation it is configured for — including workers that
received no data for that aggregation or window.

A worker may have no matching series for an aggregation (its `series_map` has
no entry for any series matching that config). In that case it will never
receive samples for that aggregation and its per-series watermarks will never
advance. Without an explicit mechanism, it would never emit `WindowCompletion`,
causing the merge worker to deadlock waiting for N completions.

**Fix: per-worker global watermark, advanced by the flush timer.**

Each first-tier worker maintains a `per_agg_watermark: HashMap<u64, i64>` —
one entry per aggregation config it knows about, initialized to `i64::MIN`.

The watermark for aggregation `agg_id` is updated by two sources:

1. **Data arrival**: when any series matching `agg_id` closes a window, the
   worker updates `per_agg_watermark[agg_id]` to the maximum watermark seen
   across all its matching series.

2. **Flush timer**: on each `WorkerMessage::Flush`, for every aggregation config
   the worker is configured with, the worker advances `per_agg_watermark[agg_id]`
   to at least `now_ms - allowed_lateness_ms` (wall-clock derived floor). This
   ensures forward progress even when no data arrives for a given aggregation.

After updating `per_agg_watermark[agg_id]`, the worker calls
`window_manager.closed_windows(previous_agg_wm, new_agg_wm)` and emits a
`WindowCompletion` for each newly closed window — even if no partials were
emitted for that window from this worker.

This guarantees that every merge worker eventually receives exactly N
`WindowCompletion` messages per `(aggregation_id, window)` — one from each of
the N first-tier workers — and can finalize without deadlock.

#### Late data and `ForwardToStore`

When `LateDataPolicy::ForwardToStore` is active and a late sample falls into an
already-closed (and potentially already-merged) window, the first-tier worker
emits a `PartialWindowAggregate` for that window as it does today.

The merge tier treats these late partials as **store appends**, not as
corrections to a finalized canonical entry. The canonical merged output written
at finalization time remains unchanged. The store accumulates the late partial
alongside it, and query-time `SummaryMergeMultipleExec` merges them on read.

This is consistent with the existing `ForwardToStore` semantics and avoids the
need to read-modify-write a finalized store entry. The benefit of the merge tier
(one canonical output per window) applies only to on-time data; late corrections
fall back to the same append + query-time-merge path as the non-merge-tier
design.

#### Merge-worker state

Each merge worker maintains two separate tables, separating window-level
completion tracking from key-level partial accumulation:

```rust
struct MergeWorkerState {
    /// Per-window: which first-tier workers have sent WindowCompletion.
    /// Key: (aggregation_id, window_start_ms, window_end_ms)
    window_completions: HashMap<(u64, u64, u64), HashSet<usize>>,

    /// Per (aggregation_id, key, window): partial accumulators received so far.
    /// Key: (aggregation_id, key, window_start_ms, window_end_ms)
    pending_partials: HashMap<(u64, Option<KeyByLabelValues>, u64, u64), Vec<Box<dyn AggregateCore>>>,
}
```

Separating these two maps is necessary because:

- `window_completions` is indexed by window only (no key) — matching
  `WindowCompletion`'s key-less definition.
- `pending_partials` is indexed by `(agg_id, key, window)` — matching the
  per-key partials arriving from first-tier workers.

Applying a single key-less `WindowCompletion` to the per-key `pending_partials`
map requires only a lookup in `window_completions` followed by iteration over
all `pending_partials` entries sharing the same `(agg_id, window)` — done once
at finalization, not per-completion.

#### Merge-tier watermark and pending state eviction

The merge tier tracks a **merge watermark** per aggregation:

```rust
merge_watermark: HashMap<u64, i64>  // aggregation_id -> min watermark across sources
```

Each `WindowCompletion` carries `worker_watermark_ms`. The merge worker updates:

```rust
merge_watermark[agg_id] = min over all sources of their latest watermark_ms
```

Any pending window with `window_end_ms <= merge_watermark[agg_id]` that has
also received all N completions is eligible for finalization and eviction. Any
pending window older than `merge_watermark[agg_id] - eviction_grace_period_ms`
is force-finalized with whatever partials have arrived, even if not all N
completions have been received (handles stuck or lagging first-tier workers).

This bounds the size of `window_completions` and `pending_partials` in
proportion to `eviction_grace_period_ms / slide_interval_ms`, regardless of
workload.

#### Completion protocol

A merge worker finalizes all keys for a window when:

```text
window_completions[(agg_id, window_start, window_end)].len() == num_first_tier_workers
```

Steps:
1. Check `window_completions` for the window just completed.
2. If all N sources have completed, collect all `pending_partials` entries
   matching `(agg_id, *, window_start, window_end)` — iterate over keys
   observed for that window.
3. For each observed key, merge its partial accumulators and write one
   canonical `PrecomputedOutput` to the final store.
4. Remove the window from both `window_completions` and all matching entries
   in `pending_partials`.

If a `WindowCompletion` arrives for a window that has no partials in
`pending_partials` (i.e., no series on any first-tier worker matched this
aggregation for this window), the merge worker simply records the completion.
Once all N completions arrive, there is nothing to finalize and the window is
evicted immediately.

#### Finalization

When a window is complete, the merge worker:

1. Iterates all keys observed for `(agg_id, window)` in `pending_partials`.
2. For each key, folds its `Vec<Box<dyn AggregateCore>>` with
   `AggregateCore::merge_with()`.
3. Writes one canonical `PrecomputedOutput` per key to the final store.
4. Removes all entries for this window from both state maps.

This produces the canonical shape expected by merge-tier-enabled reads:

```
store[(agg_id, key=(j1), [0,30s))]  -> [merged_acc]
store[(agg_id, key=(j1), [10s,40s))] -> [merged_acc]
```

and for tumbling windows:

```
store[(agg_id, key=(j1), [0,60s))] -> [merged_acc]
```

#### Query-path simplification

With the merge tier enabled for an aggregation:

- **Instant sliding queries** become exact reads with no cross-worker merge.
- **Range sliding queries** iterate exact sliding windows and read one merged
  accumulator per key/window.
- **Tumbling queries** read already-merged buckets instead of merging
  per-worker fragments on demand.
- **General aggregate queries** over Sum, Min/Max, KLL, CMS, HydraKLL, etc. can
  all consume canonical outputs if their aggregation id is merge-tier-enabled.

This removes the current ambiguity where the store can return multiple exact
matches for one logical output window and the query layer must decide whether
to merge or pick one. Late corrections (via `ForwardToStore`) continue to use
query-time merge for their incremental updates.

#### Why a separate merge worker is preferable to routing by grouping key

Compared with "route all contributing series for a grouping key to the same
worker", the merge-tier approach:

- preserves per-series ownership in the first tier
- avoids hot-spotting first-tier workers on popular grouping keys
- keeps pane state local to the ingest worker that already owns the series
- allows the merge tier to scale independently of ingest

Compared with routing the merge tier by `(agg_id, key, window)`, window-level
routing:

- avoids broadcasting `WindowCompletion` to every merge worker (O(M) fanout)
- keeps all keys for a window co-located, enabling one-pass finalization
- uses the same MPSC channel for partials and completions, giving free
  ordering guarantees between them

The cost is that all keys for a window go to the same merge worker, which
limits key-level parallelism within a window. In practice, the number of
distinct keys per window is bounded and this is not a bottleneck.

#### Failure and persistence considerations

This design introduces **merge-tier in-flight state** in addition to the
existing pane state in first-tier workers. To make the whole system robust, the
same durability story must cover both tiers:

- first-tier WAL / pane snapshots protect open panes
- merge-tier WAL / partial-window snapshots protect unfinalized merge state

Without persistence, a merge-worker crash loses pending cross-worker fan-in even
if the first-tier workers are healthy. The merge-tier watermark and
force-eviction after `eviction_grace_period_ms` bound the exposure window.

#### Rollout strategy

The cleanest migration path is:

1. Keep the current store-append + query-time-merge model as the default.
2. Add `per_agg_watermark` tracking and flush-timer-driven `WindowCompletion`
   emission to first-tier workers (required for correctness before any merge
   worker is deployed).
3. Add an optional `MergeWorkerOutputSink` controlled by a per-aggregation flag.
4. Enable the merge tier first for **sliding-window aggregations** where the
   benefit is largest.
5. Expand to tumbling windows and other high-fan-in accumulators once stable.

Step 2 must precede step 3: first-tier workers must emit `WindowCompletion` for
all aggregations via the flush timer before any merge worker is deployed,
otherwise merge workers deadlock on their first window.

## 5. Data Model

### PrecomputedOutput

```rust
pub struct PrecomputedOutput {
    pub start_timestamp: u64,              // window start (ms)
    pub end_timestamp: u64,                // window end (ms)
    pub key: Option<KeyByLabelValues>,     // grouping key (e.g. method="GET")
    pub aggregation_id: u64,
}
```

### KeyByLabelValues

Ordered vector of label values matching the `grouping_labels` in the aggregation
config. Serialized as semicolon-delimited strings for hashing/storage.

### AggregationConfig

Loaded from `streaming_config.yaml`:

```rust
pub struct AggregationConfig {
    pub aggregation_id: u64,
    pub aggregation_type: String,        // "SingleSubpopulation" | "MultipleSubpopulation"
    pub aggregation_sub_type: String,    // "Sum" | "Min" | "Max" | "Increase" | "KLL" | ...
    pub parameters: HashMap<String, Value>,
    pub grouping_labels: KeyByLabelNames,
    pub window_size: u64,                // seconds
    pub slide_interval: u64,             // seconds (0 = tumbling)
    pub metric: String,
    pub spatial_filter: String,
    pub num_aggregates_to_retain: Option<u64>,
    // ...
}
```

## 6. Store Integration

### Write path

`OutputSink.emit_batch()` → `Store.insert_precomputed_output_batch()`

Because the precompute engine runs in the same process as the store, the write
path involves **zero serialization and zero network hops**. Closed window
accumulators flow from worker to store entirely as in-memory trait objects:

```
Worker: updater.take_accumulator()     → Box<dyn AggregateCore>  (in-memory)
   ↓  (direct function call, no IPC)
OutputSink: store.insert_precomputed_output_batch(outputs)  (pass-through)
   ↓  (direct function call, same process)
SketchStore: HashMap entry insert   → Box<dyn AggregateCore>  (stored as-is)
```

No serialization, deserialization, compression, or network transfer occurs
between the worker extracting an accumulator and the store persisting it.
The only network hops in the system are at the edges: HTTP ingest (in) and
HTTP query (out). Serialization of accumulators only happens on the read path
when query results are returned to clients.

This is in contrast to the external Kafka ingest path, where precomputes from
Arroyo/Flink arrive hex-encoded + gzip-compressed + MessagePack-serialized and
require multiple deserialization steps.

The `SketchStore` (PerKey variant) uses:
```
DashMap<aggregation_id, Arc<RwLock<StoreKeyData>>>
```
where:
```rust
struct StoreKeyData {
    time_map: HashMap<(u64, u64), Vec<(Option<KeyByLabelValues>, Box<dyn AggregateCore>)>>,
    read_counts: HashMap<(u64, u64), u64>,
}
```

Multiple entries per `(start_ts, end_ts)` are allowed — they are appended, not
overwritten. This is what makes `ForwardToStore` late-data policy work: the late
mini-accumulator is stored alongside the original window accumulator.

### Read path / query-time merge

At query time, `PrecomputedSummaryReadExec` reads sparse buckets from the store.
`SummaryMergeMultipleExec` groups by label key and merges via
`accumulator.merge_with()`.

The `NaiveMerger` re-merges all accumulators in the window on each slide.
The store's existing multi-entry-per-window design means late data is
automatically combined with original window data at query time.

### Cleanup policies

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| CircularBuffer | Keep N most recent windows (4x `num_aggregates_to_retain`) |
| ReadBased | Remove after `read_count >= threshold` |
| NoCleanup | Retain forever |

## 7. Late Data Handling

Two checks determine whether a sample is "late":

1. **Watermark check** (sample-level): `ts < watermark - allowed_lateness_ms` →
   sample is dropped entirely before reaching any aggregation logic.

2. **Window closure check** (window-level): the sample passes the watermark check
   but targets a window that is already closed
   (`window not in active_windows && watermark >= window_end`).

For case 2, the `LateDataPolicy` controls behavior:

- **Drop**: log at debug level and skip. No ghost accumulator is created
  (fixing the original bug where `or_insert_with` would create orphaned entries).

- **ForwardToStore**: create a fresh `AccumulatorUpdater`, feed the single
  late sample, wrap as `PrecomputedOutput`, and push into the same `emit_batch`
  as normal closed-window outputs. The store appends it alongside the original
  window data, and query-time merge combines them.

## 8. Concurrency Model

The current implementation is **single-machine, multi-threaded**. All components
(HTTP server, workers, store) run within a single OS process as Tokio async
tasks on a shared thread pool. There is no distributed coordination, no
cross-machine communication, and no external dependency beyond the store.

- **Ingest HTTP handlers**: Per-connector Axum async handlers (Prometheus, VictoriaMetrics) with shared format-agnostic routing logic.
- **SeriesRouter**: Lock-free hash routing. No shared mutable state.
- **Workers**: Each worker is a single Tokio task that owns its `series_map`
  exclusively. No locks needed within a worker — thread safety comes from
  the hash-partitioning guarantee that each series is assigned to exactly one
  worker.
- **OutputSink / Store**: Thread-safe (`Arc<dyn OutputSink>`, DashMap-backed store).
  Workers emit concurrently; the PerKey store uses per-aggregation_id RwLocks
  to minimize contention.
- **Flush timer**: Separate Tokio task, communicates via the same MPSC channels.

Scaling beyond a single machine would require partitioning the series space
across multiple engine instances (e.g. via consistent hashing at the load
balancer level), each running this same single-process architecture
independently.

## 9. Performance Characteristics

**Ingest path (per batch):**
- Sample insert: O(log B) per sample (BTreeMap, B = buffer size)
- Pane routing: O(A) per sample (A = matching aggregations; each sample
  touches exactly 1 pane per aggregation, regardless of window overlap)
- Accumulator update: O(1) for Sum/MinMax, O(log k) for KLL
- Window close: O(W-1) merges per closed window (W = window_size / slide_interval)

**Memory:**
- O(S × N) buffered samples (S = max per series, N = active series)
- O(A × W_open) active pane accumulators (fewer than window accumulators
  since panes are shared across overlapping windows)

**Throughput (measured, 2x Xeon E5-2630 v3, 32 logical CPUs, 125 GiB RAM):**
- Raw mode, `NoopOutputSink`, 16 workers: **~8.9M samples/sec** flush throughput; near-linear scaling (19x at 16 workers vs 16x ideal).
- Windowed aggregation (Sum, W=1-6), 4 workers: **~660K samples/sec** E2E; throughput is nearly identical across W=1 and W=6, confirming the pane-based optimization.
- Workers process in parallel with no cross-shard coordination.

**Benchmark caveat -- `workers = senders` coupling:** The raw-mode scalability benchmark uses one concurrent HTTP sender per worker. The 1-worker baseline is bottlenecked by a single sender (one CPU for Snappy compression, one in-flight HTTP connection); at 16 workers, 16 senders parallelize compression across cores and pipeline connections. The apparent super-linear speedup (9.37x at 8 workers, 19.13x at 16 workers) reflects sender-side parallelism as much as engine-side scaling. A clean engine-scaling measurement would fix sender count and vary only worker count.

## 10. CLI Usage

### Standalone binary

```bash
cargo run --bin precompute_engine -- \
  --streaming-config streaming_config.yaml \
  --num-workers 4 \
  --allowed-lateness-ms 5000 \
  --max-buffer-per-series 10000 \
  --flush-interval-ms 1000 \
  --channel-buffer-size 10000 \
  --query-port 8080 \
  --lock-strategy per-key \
  --late-data-policy drop
```

### Embedded in main binary

The precompute engine is also embedded in the main `query_engine_rust` binary,
auto-enabled by `--streaming-engine=precompute`. Ingest reaches it via the
OTLP receiver (which holds the same `IngestState` handle), and it shares the
store with the Kafka consumer path.

## 11. Testing

- **Unit tests -- `worker.rs` (correctness, via `CapturingOutputSink`):**

  | Test | What it verifies |
  |---|---|
  | `test_raw_mode_forwarding` | 3 samples -> 3 emits; `start == end == ts`, `SumAccumulator.sum == value` |
  | `test_tumbling_window_correctness` | Samples at t=1s/5s/9s; window [0,10s) closes on t=10s; `sum=6` |
  | `test_sliding_window_pane_sharing` | Sample at t=15s in 30s/10s window -> 2 emits for [0,30s) and [10s,40s), both `sum=42` via shared pane snapshot/take |
  | `test_groupby_separate_emits_per_series` | Two series (`host=A`, `host=B`) on same worker -> 2 independent `MultipleSumAccumulator` emits (no ingest-time cross-series merge) |
  | `test_late_data_drop` | Sample behind `watermark - allowed_lateness_ms` with `Drop` policy -> 0 emits |
  | `test_late_data_forward_to_store` | Late sample for evicted pane with `ForwardToStore` -> 1 emit as mini-accumulator with correct window bounds and sum |

- **Unit tests -- other modules**: `window_manager.rs` (tumbling/sliding arithmetic, pane enumeration, closure detection), `series_buffer.rs` (ordering, watermark), `accumulator_factory.rs` (updater creation and reset), `series_router.rs` (consistent hash routing), `config.rs` (defaults).

- **E2E coverage**: end-to-end paths now run through the OTLP receiver
  driving the same `IngestState` (`tests/e2e_modified_otlp_sketch_path.rs`,
  `tests/edge_runtime_consumes_precompute_rs.rs`; the runnable demo
  lives in ASAPCollector). The legacy in-process remote-write E2E binaries
  (`bin/test_e2e_precompute.rs`, `bin/e2e_quickstart_resource_test.rs`,
  `bin/bench_precompute_sketch.rs`) and the equivalent test
  (`tests/e2e_precompute_equivalence.rs`) were removed when the
  remote-write ingest path was deleted.

## 12. Known Data Loss Cases and Fault Tolerance TODOs

The engine is currently in-memory and single-process with no persistence of in-flight window state. The following cases result in data loss:

| # | Case | When it occurs | Mitigation status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Explicit late drop** | `LateDataPolicy::Drop` + `ts < watermark - allowed_lateness_ms` | Intended; use `ForwardToStore` to avoid |
| 2 | **Intra-batch lateness** | Within a single `process_samples` call, `current_wm` is set to the batch's max timestamp before pane routing; with `allowed_lateness_ms=0` every sample below the batch max is dropped | Set `allowed_lateness_ms` >= max timestamp spread within a producer batch |
| 3 | **Evicted pane + Drop** | Sample passes watermark check but its pane was already evicted (window closed); `Drop` policy discards it | Use `ForwardToStore` |
| 4 | **No matching config** | `matching_agg_configs` returns empty -- metric name in the series key does not match any config's `metric` or `spatial_filter`; worker silently returns `Ok(())` | No warning is logged. TODO: emit a metric or log at warn level for unmatched series |
| 5 | **Open panes on shutdown** | `flush_all` only emits windows already closed by the watermark; panes that are still open at shutdown are discarded | TODO (see below) |
| 6 | **Worker panic** | Tokio task dies; all series owned by that worker lose their pane state; subsequent sends log a warning and drop | TODO (see below) |

### TODO: open-pane flush on shutdown

`flush_all` currently only closes windows whose `end <= watermark`. On graceful shutdown it should optionally force-close all open panes by advancing each series watermark to `i64::MAX` (or to `current_wm + window_size_ms`) before the final flush. This would emit partial windows with whatever samples have accumulated, allowing downstream consumers to decide whether to use them.

This behaviour should be opt-in (a `force_flush_on_shutdown: bool` config flag) because partial windows can be misleading for consumers that expect complete windows.

### TODO: warn on unmatched series

Case 4 is silent and hard to diagnose. The fix is a single warn-level log (rate-limited per series key) in `get_or_create_series_state` when `aggregations.is_empty()`, plus a Prometheus counter `precompute_unmatched_series_total`.

### TODO: worker restart on panic

Currently a panicked worker is never restarted. The engine should catch task failures (via `JoinHandle`) in the main `run()` loop and respawn the worker with a fresh receiver, re-routing future series to surviving workers (or to the replacement) in the meantime. In-flight pane state for the crashed worker is still lost -- full recovery would require the WAL approach below.

### TODO: write-ahead log (WAL) for pane state

Cases 5 and 6 both stem from the same root cause: pane accumulators exist only in memory. A WAL would persist each pane update (series key, aggregation id, pane start, serialized accumulator delta) to disk or an external log (e.g. Kafka) before acknowledging the ingest HTTP request. On restart, the worker replays the WAL to reconstruct open panes before resuming normal processing.

Trade-offs:
- Serialization cost: accumulators must be serializable (all current types are, via `rmp-serde`)
- WAL volume: one entry per sample per matching aggregation config -- potentially high; batching per pane per flush interval reduces this significantly
- Recovery time: proportional to WAL size since last checkpoint
- Complexity: requires a checkpoint mechanism to bound recovery time and WAL size

A lighter alternative: **periodic pane snapshots** written to disk at each flush interval. On restart, replay only samples received since the last snapshot. This bounds recovery time to `flush_interval_ms` worth of samples at the cost of snapshot I/O every flush cycle.
