# Design: Sketch DB — Storage Engine as a Refreshable Materialized-View DB

**Status:** Draft / exploration. No code in this PR implements this beyond the
hot-reload plumbing; the doc is here so the design is reviewable alongside the
hot-reload work it builds on.

**Audience:** anyone asking "if `SimpleMapStore` is going to be the long-term
sketch storage engine, what does it need to look like so that a changing
controller workload and a query engine sharing it don't step on each other?"

**Companion docs:**
- [`design-simple-map-store-persistence.md`](design-simple-map-store-persistence.md) — the current LSM-style parts-based persistence layer this builds on
- [DataCollector#153 pipeline query catalog](https://github.com/ProjectASAP/DataCollector/pull/153) — the pipeline-level dual-lane architecture (sketch lane + Gorilla/S3 archive lane) that this design depends on

---

## 1. Motivation

`SimpleMapStore` today is a KV store bucketed by `aggregation_id`. That was
enough for "write sketches, read them back by id." It is no longer enough once:

- The controller reconfigures sketches at runtime in response to a changing
  query workload (parameter upgrades, new query patterns, retirement).
- Queries should transparently work across those reconfigurations, with no
  data cliff at the upgrade boundary.
- The store needs to give the controller back real workload observations
  (bytes stored, query latency, merge cost) to drive cost-based planning.
- Persistent storage means there is no implicit cleanup mechanism — any data
  written to disk stays there until something explicitly retires it.

What's needed is a storage engine that treats sketches as first-class typed
values with per-type merge semantics, tracks schema per aggregation across
time, and supports refreshing itself from the archive when the schema
changes. In database terms: the sketches are **materialized views** over
the Gorilla/S3 archive; the store is a refreshable-MV engine specialized
for sketch types.

---

## 2. Design principles

1. **Per-`aggregation_id` namespace isolation.** Each `agg_id` is its own
   logical namespace with a pinned schema (sketch type, parameters,
   grouping labels, window size). Writes are validated against that
   schema. Compaction never crosses `agg_id` boundaries.
2. **Schema timeline is first-class.** The store knows, for any metric,
   which `aggregation_id` served it during which time range. Query
   engine queries by metric; store handles the per-`agg_id` dispatch.
3. **Semantic compaction.** LSM levels represent decreasing temporal
   resolution. Compaction calls the sketch type's merge operator; level
   N+1 holds entries that are the merge of multiple level-N entries at
   a coarser window.
4. **Typed auxiliary columns.** `count`, `sum`, `min`, `max` are stored
   alongside the sketch bytes, not inside them. Queries that only need
   these scalar stats never pay the sketch deserialization cost.
5. **Archive is the source of truth.** Sketches are rebuildable from
   the Gorilla/S3 archive. The store supports explicit backfill from
   archive into any `agg_id` for any time range.
6. **Monotonic, non-reused `aggregation_id`s.** A reconfigure that
   changes parameters is always "retire old id + create new id", never
   "mutate in place." This is a contract on the controller; the store
   enforces it via a write-side schema barrier.

## 4. Storage schema

### 4.1 Per-entry record

```rust
struct SketchEntry {
    // Identity
    agg_id: u64,
    group_key: String,      // e.g. "service=auth;region=us-east"
    window_start: u64,      // business-time window bounds
    window_end: u64,

    // Typed auxiliary columns — scalars queryable without
    // deserializing sketch_bytes
    count: u64,
    sum: f64,
    min: f64,
    max: f64,

    // Sketch payload
    sketch_type: SketchType, // redundant with agg_id's schema; enables
                             // polymorphic reads and self-describing dumps
    sketch_bytes: Vec<u8>,

    // Provenance
    origin: EntryOrigin,     // Native | Backfilled { job_id }
    ingest_ts: u64,          // when this record was written
}

enum EntryOrigin {
    /// Written by the live ingest path — precompute worker flushed a
    /// window close.
    Native,
    /// Written by the backfill service from archive raw data. The
    /// job_id lets the system correlate with the BackfillJob that
    /// produced it (for re-runs, debugging, idempotency).
    Backfilled { job_id: u64 },
}
```

Why `count`/`sum`/`min`/`max` are not inside the sketch:

1. `sum_over_time`, `count_over_time`, `max_over_time`, `min_over_time`
   are the overwhelming majority of production queries. They should
   never pay the sketch-deserialize cost.
2. These stats are already tracked losslessly by DataCollector's
   processors (they live in the typed `*SketchDataPoint` proto fields
   as first-class numbers). We are preserving that typing end-to-end
   instead of forcing them to travel through the sketch blob.

### 4.2 Primary key and secondary index

Two access patterns dominate:

| Pattern | Source | Key order |
|---|---|---|
| "all groups at time T" | batch jobs, controller workload scans | `(agg_id, window_start, group_key)` |
| "one group over time range" | dashboard queries, `quantile_over_time(…) by (svc)` | `(agg_id, group_key, window_start)` |

The store maintains the first as the primary index (SSTable sort order) and
the second as a secondary index. Primary order wins during compaction
(spatial locality across a single window close is the common ingest
pattern); secondary index is maintained via an auxiliary log that the
reader consults for single-group time scans.

### 4.3 Label posting index

For controller workload queries like "how many distinct services does
metric `X` have?" and for label filter pushdown (`service=auth`), a
per-`agg_id` label posting index maps:

```
label_postings[agg_id]: HashMap<(label_name, label_value), RoaringBitmap<group_key_hash>>
```

Roaring bitmaps keep this compact even for high-cardinality labels.
Compared to scanning every group, a label match becomes an O(1) bitmap
lookup.

---

## 5. Per-`agg_id` schema and its lifetime

### 5.1 `AggSchema` — the pinned metadata

```rust
struct AggSchema {
    agg_id: u64,
    metric_name: String,                // which metric this agg serves
    sketch_type: SketchType,            // pinned for agg's lifetime
    parameters: HashMap<String, Value>, // pinned for agg's lifetime
    grouping_labels: Vec<String>,       // pinned for agg's lifetime
    window_size: u64,                   // pinned for agg's lifetime
    slide_interval: u64,                // pinned for agg's lifetime

    // Lifecycle
    created_at: u64,
    retired_at: Option<u64>,
    expires_at: Option<u64>,   // = retired_at + configured retention
}

enum AggStatus {
    /// Listed in current StreamingConfig. Writes accepted.
    Active,
    /// Removed from StreamingConfig but within retention. Writes
    /// rejected; reads allowed.
    Retired { expires_in: Duration },
    /// Past retention. Scheduled for deletion.
    Expired,
}
```

### 5.2 Status transitions

```
┌─────────┐  controller POSTs new StreamingConfig
│ (none)  │  with this agg_id included
└────┬────┘
     │ create_schema()
     ▼
┌─────────┐  controller POSTs new StreamingConfig
│ Active  │  that removes this agg_id
└────┬────┘
     │ retire_schema()
     ▼                                  ┌──────────────┐
┌─────────┐  time passes until         │ Compaction    │
│ Retired │  retired_at + retention    │ policy drops  │
└────┬────┘                            │ to Partial /  │
     │ expire()                         │ None as       │
     ▼                                  │ expires_in    │
┌─────────┐  TTL sweep                  │ shrinks       │
│ Expired │ ─────► DELETE               └──────────────┘
└─────────┘
```

Each transition is atomic on the ArcSwap that carries `StreamingConfig`
plus an explicit DB call (no polling; Active→Retired happens when the
HTTP handler that processes the config swap sees the id missing from
the new config).

### 5.3 Write-side schema barrier

Every write to the store is gated by `is_writable(agg_id)`:

```rust
fn write_entry(&self, entry: SketchEntry) -> Result<(), WriteError> {
    let schema = self.schemas.get(entry.agg_id).ok_or(WriteError::UnknownAgg)?;
    match schema.status() {
        AggStatus::Active => { /* validate entry matches schema, write */ }
        AggStatus::Retired { .. } => Err(WriteError::RetiredAgg),
        AggStatus::Expired => Err(WriteError::ExpiredAgg),
    }
}
```

This is the authoritative "no writes after retirement" guarantee.
Even if a slow in-flight ingest batch routes stale data to the
retired agg_id, the store rejects it. Workers log the rejection and
drop the batch.

---

## 6. Schema timeline — the key to query continuity

### 6.1 What it is

```rust
metric_timelines: HashMap<
    MetricName,
    BTreeMap<TimeRange, AggId>
>
```

For each metric, an ordered list of `(time_range, agg_id)` segments
covering its history. Non-overlapping by construction (the controller
contract: a metric has one Active agg_id at a time, plus zero or more
Retired overlapping within retention).

Example for metric `latency`:

```
│── id=1 (CMS256) ──┤
                    │── id=17 (CMS1024) ──┤
                                          │── id=42 (KLL200) ──►
T=0                 T=day1                T=day3              now
```

### 6.2 `timeline_for_metric(metric, t1, t2) -> Vec<(AggId, TimeRange)>`

The single most important query-engine-facing API. Given a metric and a
time range, returns the agg_ids that cover the range (in time order),
each clipped to the query range.

```rust
timeline_for_metric("latency", day1-1h, day1+1h)
  → [(1,  [day1-1h, day1]),
     (17, [day1,    day1+1h])]
```

Query engine uses this to dispatch per-segment. DB provides it from an
in-memory BTree; cost is one HashMap lookup + BTree range scan,
nanoseconds.

### 6.3 Per-segment query dispatch

When the query engine processes `count_over_time(latency[24h])` at a
moment spanning multiple segments:

```rust
fn query_metric(&self, metric: &str, range: (u64, u64),
                statistic: Statistic) -> QueryResult {
    let segments = self.timeline_for_metric(metric, range.0, range.1);
    let mut partials = Vec::new();
    for (agg_id, seg_range) in segments {
        // Check coverage — was this segment written by Native ingest,
        // is a Backfill in progress, or is the range not covered?
        match self.coverage(agg_id, seg_range) {
            Coverage::Complete => {
                partials.push(self.query_range(agg_id, seg_range, statistic));
            }
            Coverage::BackfillInProgress { pct } => {
                // Either wait (if eta short) or fall back
                partials.push(self.fallback_exact(metric, seg_range, statistic));
            }
            Coverage::Missing => {
                partials.push(self.fallback_exact(metric, seg_range, statistic));
            }
        }
    }
    combine_statistic(partials, statistic)
}
```

`combine_statistic` depends on the statistic:

| Statistic | Cross-segment combinability |
|---|---|
| Count, Sum, Min, Max, Cardinality (HLL) | Combinable (addition / max / HLL-OR) |
| Quantile, TopK | **Not combinable across different sketch types / parameters.** Returns `PartialResult { covered, missing }`. |

When a statistic is not combinable across schema changes, the user sees
a `PartialResult` that the query engine can render as a warning or a
fall-through to the exact DB for the missing segment. Crucially, this
failure mode is **explicit** — the user knows they are seeing a
schema-change artifact.

---

## 7. Semantic compaction

### 7.1 Level = temporal resolution

```
Level 0:  10s windows   (live ingest writes here)
Level 1:  1min windows   (merge 6 L0 entries)
Level 2:  5min windows   (merge 5 L1 entries)
Level 3:  1h windows     (merge 12 L2 entries)
Level 4:  1d windows     (merge 24 L3 entries)
```

Each compaction step takes N entries of the same `(agg_id, group_key)`
at level L and merges them into one entry at level L+1 covering a
bigger window. The merge call is the sketch type's `merge_with` trait
method.

Query cost scales with level: "last 1h" reads a level-2 entry; "last
30 days" reads 30 level-4 entries. The coarsest level is bounded by
`retention`.

### 7.2 Compaction policy per `AggStatus`

```rust
fn compaction_policy(schema: &AggSchema) -> Policy {
    match schema.status() {
        Active                           => Policy::FullCompact,
        Retired { expires_in: > 24h }    => Policy::CompactUpTo(Level::L2),
        Retired { expires_in: 1h..24h }  => Policy::CompactUpTo(Level::L1),
        Retired { expires_in: < 1h }     => Policy::NoCompact,
        Expired                          => Policy::Delete,
    }
}
```

Rationale: compaction pays off long-term (less storage, faster
queries), but once an agg is within hours of expiry, compacting it
further is wasted CPU. We gracefully unwind compaction as retirement
approaches.

### 7.3 No cross-`agg_id` compaction, ever

This is a hard invariant. Different agg_ids have different schemas and
their sketches are not generally mergeable. Compaction always groups
entries by `(agg_id, group_key)` and merges only within that.

---

## 8. Backfill — treating sketches as refreshable views

### 8.1 The core insight

Because the archive lane keeps raw data losslessly, we can rebuild any
sketch for any time range from the archive. A reconfigure that breaks
query continuity in the sketch tier can be followed by a backfill that
restores it.

```
T=0        T=upgrade                       now
│          │                                │
├──── id=1 (CMS256) data ────────┤          ← existing sketch data
│          │                                │
│          ├──── id=17 (KLL200) native ─┤  ← new sketch data from live ingest
│          │                                │
│    ┌─────┴────── backfill ──────┐         ← rebuild id=17 from archive
│    │     │                       │         for [T=upgrade - horizon, T=upgrade]
│    │     │                       │
│    ↓     ↓                       ↓
Archive (Gorilla / S3)
```

After backfill, id=17 covers the full query horizon. The user's query
"last 24h" is fully served from a single sketch, with a consistent
schema.

### 8.2 Backfill job model

```rust
struct BackfillJob {
    job_id: u64,
    agg_id: u64,
    time_range: (u64, u64),
    source: BackfillSource,
    status: BackfillStatus,
    started_at: u64,
    completed_at: Option<u64>,
    windows_done: u64,
    windows_total: u64,
}

enum BackfillSource {
    /// Read raw samples from Gorilla-compressed S3 parts.
    S3Archive { bucket: String, prefix: String },
    /// Read raw samples from the exact backend DB.
    ExactDB { url: String },
    /// Rebuild from a different sketch (rare; only when types are
    /// compatible and the source sketch is lossless w.r.t. the target).
    /// Used for lossless schema widenings, e.g. CMS(256) → CMS(2048).
    OtherSketch { source_agg_id: u64 },
}

enum BackfillStatus {
    Queued,
    Running,
    Complete,
    Failed(String),
    Cancelled,
}
```

### 8.3 Backfill is a separate worker pool

Live ingest and backfill must not starve each other:

- Live ingest has hard latency requirements (data must land in the
  current window before it closes).
- Backfill is latency-tolerant (it's catching up historical windows
  that are already closed) but CPU- and I/O-heavy.

Implementation: a dedicated `BackfillWorkerPool` with configurable
concurrency. Priority knob on each `BackfillJob`. Backfill writes go
through the same schema barrier (`is_writable(agg_id)`) as live writes
but via a distinct `write_backfilled_window()` entry point that
bypasses `WindowManager` (the window is already closed, we're just
populating it).

### 8.4 Coverage tracking

```rust
enum Coverage {
    /// This time range is fully covered by either Native writes or
    /// completed Backfilled writes. Query proceeds against sketch.
    Complete,
    /// A backfill job is in progress for this range.
    BackfillInProgress { job_id: u64, pct: f64 },
    /// This range is not covered at all.
    Missing,
}

fn coverage(&self, agg_id: u64, range: (u64, u64)) -> Coverage
```

Cached in memory keyed by `agg_id`, updated as Native writes land and
as Backfill jobs complete.

### 8.5 Deterministic rebuild

For backfill to produce "the same sketch we would have built live,"
the sketch construction must be deterministic. That means:

- The hash function seed for CMS / CountSketch / HLL must be part of
  `AggregationConfig.parameters` and stable across Native and Backfill
  paths.
- The KLL / DDSketch sampling decisions must be deterministic from
  the input sample order. This constrains how raw samples are read
  from archive — they must be replayed in the same order they were
  ingested live.
- Archive writes from DataCollector therefore need to preserve ingest
  order within a window.

This is an invariant the Gorilla processor / S3 exporter must
guarantee. Not hard, but it has to be designed in.

---

## 9. The full reconfigure workflow

```
T=0:     Config = {1: CMS(256)}
         DB schemas = {1: Active}
         Live: writing to id=1

T=swap:  Controller decides to upgrade to KLL(200).
         1. Allocates new id=17.
         2. Dual-write phase begins.
            POST /api/v1/streaming-config { 1, 17 }
            DB: schema 17 created Active; schema 1 still Active.
            IngestState routes to both id=1 and id=17.
            (Both sketches accumulating the same underlying samples.)

T=swap+Δ:
         3. Controller triggers backfill to close the historical gap
            for id=17:
            POST /api/v1/db/backfill {
              agg_id: 17,
              time_range: (swap - query_horizon, swap),
              source: S3Archive,
              priority: High,
            }
         Backfill service reads raw from S3, rebuilds KLL per window
         per group, writes to id=17 with Origin = Backfilled.

         During this phase, a query for "last 24h":
         - segments for [now-24h, swap] hit id=1 (CMS, native data)
         - segments for [swap, now] hit id=17 (KLL, native data)
         - If the statistic is combinable (Count, Sum, Min, Max, Card),
           cross-segment combine works.
         - If not (Quantile, TopK), segment [now-24h, swap] returns
           PartialResult; engine falls back for that segment.

T=backfill_done:
         id=17 now covers [swap - query_horizon, now] completely.
         A query for "last 24h" hits id=17 end-to-end, single schema.

T=backfill_done+ε:
         4. Controller removes id=1 from StreamingConfig.
            POST /api/v1/streaming-config { 17 }
            DB: schema 1 transitions Active → Retired.
            IngestState stops routing to id=1.
            Worker evict_orphaned_groups reaps (agg_id=1) GroupStates.

T=swap + retention:
         5. Schema 1 expires.
            DB TTL sweep (Phase 3 of the flusher) deletes all id=1
            data from disk based on max_ts.

         Final state: Config = {17}, DB schemas = {17: Active}.
         No tombstones, no dangling references, no agg_id-specific
         deletion needed — time-based TTL handles cleanup on a
         schema-change-oblivious index.
```

Every step is idempotent. If the controller crashes mid-workflow, the
DB state at any point is a valid state; the controller resumes from
wherever it left off by reading `/api/v1/db/schemas`.

## 10. API surface

### 10.1 Query-engine-facing API

Today the query engine says "give me data for `agg_id = 1`." In the
sketch DB it says "give me `count_over_time` for metric `latency` in
this time range" and the DB does the rest.

```rust
/// Primary query-engine entry point. Dispatches by metric, not agg_id.
fn query_metric(
    &self,
    metric: &str,
    group_filter: Option<LabelFilter>,
    time_range: (u64, u64),
    statistic: Statistic,
) -> QueryResult;

/// Point read for a known (agg_id, group_key, window). Used by
/// diagnostic tooling and by tests; not the main production path.
fn point_read(
    &self,
    agg_id: u64,
    group_key: &str,
    window_start: u64,
) -> Option<SketchEntry>;

/// Streaming scan for batch workloads. Iterator yields entries in
/// primary-key order.
fn scan(
    &self,
    agg_id: u64,
    range: (u64, u64),
    predicate: Option<LabelFilter>,
) -> impl Iterator<Item = SketchEntry>;
```

`QueryResult`:

```rust
enum QueryResult {
    /// Single value (Count, Quantile, Sum, Min, Max, Cardinality).
    Scalar { value: f64, covered: Coverage },
    /// Time series — per-window value.
    Series { points: Vec<(u64, f64)>, covered: Coverage },
    /// TopK and similar multi-value answers.
    Vector { entries: Vec<(String, f64)>, covered: Coverage },
    /// Some or all of the requested range could not be served from
    /// sketches. Caller decides whether to fall back.
    Partial {
        served: QueryResult,
        missing: Vec<(u64, u64)>,
        reason: PartialReason,
    },
}
```

### 10.2 Controller-facing API

```
GET  /api/v1/db/schemas?status=<Active|Retired|Expired>
  → list of AggSchema objects

GET  /api/v1/db/schemas/{agg_id}
  → one AggSchema + current Coverage per time range

GET  /api/v1/db/timeline/{metric}
  → schema timeline for a metric

GET  /api/v1/db/stats/{agg_id}
  → {
      bytes_stored,
      entry_count,
      avg_sketch_size,
      queries_served,
      p50_query_latency_ms,
      p99_query_latency_ms,
      last_queried_at,
      avg_merge_cost_per_query,
    }

POST /api/v1/db/backfill
  body: { agg_id, time_range, source, priority }
  → { job_id }

GET  /api/v1/db/backfill/{job_id}
  → { status, progress, eta }

DELETE /api/v1/db/backfill/{job_id}
  → cancel running job

POST /api/v1/db/cost_estimate
  body: { metric, sketch_type, parameters, grouping, window_size }
  → estimated { bytes_per_sec, cpu_per_sec, storage_per_day }

GET  /api/v1/db/pressure
  → { write_queue_depth, compaction_lag, memory_used, memory_limit }
```

These are the primitives the controller uses to close its planning
loop. Without them the controller plans in the blind; with them it
can run cost-based optimization with real observations.

## 11. Implementation phases

This design is intentionally larger than one PR. Suggested rollout:

**Phase 1 — Typed aux columns + query pushdown (small, high-leverage).**
Add `count` / `sum` / `min` / `max` as typed columns on each
`SketchEntry`. Implement `query_range_statistic` that scans the index
and computes these scalars without deserializing sketch bytes. No
schema timeline yet, no backfill yet.

**Phase 2 — Per-`agg_id` schema + write barrier.**
Introduce `AggSchema` with Active/Retired/Expired states. Wire the
ArcSwap config-swap handler to create/retire schemas. Add
`is_writable(agg_id)` barrier on the write path.

**Phase 3 — Schema timeline + metric-based query dispatch.**
Build the `metric_timelines` index. Change the query engine's primary
entry point from "by agg_id" to "by metric." Implement per-segment
dispatch with `combine_statistic` for combinable cases.

**Phase 4 — Semantic compaction.**
Add level-aware compaction with sketch-type merge dispatch. Policy
table per `AggStatus`.

**Phase 5 — Backfill service.**
Independent worker pool. `write_backfilled_window` bypass of
WindowManager. `Coverage` tracking. Controller-facing `/backfill`
endpoints.

**Phase 6 — Controller-facing metadata APIs.**
`/stats`, `/timeline`, `/cost_estimate`, `/pressure`. This is what
lets the controller's planner use real observations.

**Phase 7 — Secondary indexes.**
Label postings for fast filter pushdown. Roaring bitmaps per
`(agg_id, label_name, label_value)`.

Phase 1 is largely orthogonal to the others and can ship as an
isolated improvement. Phases 2–3 are the conceptual core — everything
else builds on them. Phases 4–7 are optimizations.

## 12. Relationship to the hot-reload PR (PR #16)

PR #16 gets the runtime-reload machinery right: `ArcSwap` is shared,
all consumers read the current config at the same instant, orphaned
`GroupState` entries are evicted after their windows drain. It
establishes the monotonic-`aggregation_id` + time-TTL contract that
this design assumes.

PR #16 does **not** implement any of the sketch DB architecture
described here. In PR #16:

- There is no `AggSchema` metadata object; the store relies on
  `AggregationConfig` being in the current `StreamingConfig` plus
  time-based TTL to handle retirement.
- There is no schema timeline; queries that span a reconfigure
  boundary see a data cliff at the swap point. This is the known
  query-continuity gap that motivates Phase 3 / Phase 5 of this
  design.
- There is no backfill; once a new agg_id is created, its historical
  coverage grows from zero in real time. The user's intuition that
  backfill from archive is the right answer is captured here as the
  eventual design target but is not implemented yet.
- The storage layer still treats everything by `(agg_id, window,
  group_key)` — no sketch-aware compaction, no typed aux columns, no
  label postings.

So PR #16 is the **foundation** — hot-reload is a hard prerequisite
for everything above — but the sketch DB design is a much larger
program of work.

## 13. Open questions

1. **Where do backfill-source hash seeds live?** To make Backfilled
   sketches byte-identical to what live ingest would have produced,
   the hash function seeds need to be reproducible. Proposal: include
   them in `AggregationConfig.parameters`. Requires a small
   sketchlib-go / sketchlib-rust change to accept an external seed.

2. **What does the controller do when a backfill fails partway
   through?** Proposal: job_id is idempotent; controller retries
   with exponential backoff; if persistent failure, proceed without
   the backfilled range (query engine falls back for that subrange).

3. **How much archive retention is needed?** Archive retention must
   be ≥ the longest `backfill horizon` the controller ever requests,
   which is the longest query range users will issue that spans a
   reconfigure. If archive retention is 7 days and queries never look
   back more than 24h, that's fine. Needs to be tracked as a
   deployment-level configuration.

4. **Can an in-progress backfill be query-visible with partial
   coverage?** Proposal: yes — `Coverage::BackfillInProgress` is a
   real state. The query engine can wait (if ETA is short), combine
   partial sketch with partial fallback, or serve from fallback only.
   Trade-off knob on the query level.

5. **Does the current `SimpleMapStore` schema support all of Phase 1
   without disk migration?** Mostly. `count`/`sum`/`min`/`max` can be
   written as separate columns in the existing part format; readers
   that don't know about them can skip. The label posting index
   (Phase 7) needs a new on-disk structure and will require a new
   part version.

6. **Relationship to PromSketch?** PromSketch (the exponential-
   histogram-based in-memory sketch store) serves a different tier
   (live queries against raw samples). The sketch DB described here
   serves precomputed materialized sketches. The query engine's
   routing logic picks between them: PromSketch for recent fine-grained
   live queries, sketch DB for long-horizon precomputed queries,
   exact fallback for anything else. All three should share the
   schema-timeline / backfill concepts so that the controller can
   reason about them uniformly.
